FilmToPic
=========

Takes a Video and inserts every 60th frame into images.

The software is still veeery simple. It is basically just a little thing I needed to get done. So it has no GUI and crashes if you feed it anything other than the right video with the right codec. If your video will not work I recomend using the VLC-player to convert the format.
